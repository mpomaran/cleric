This is the initial commit for the IoT devices (intended to cooperate with this one: https://github.com/mpomaran/arctic) based on the Granada framework.

This is in the very early stage, at the moment I've published only precompiled Granada (https://github.com/webappsdk/granada), CppRestSdk (https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk) and boost libraries.

The value added over the Granada and CppRestSdk is:
 - compiles under VS 2017 community
 - contains pre-compiled dependencies (unzip .7z archive)
 - uses cmake as a build system for linux portability

Beware: I did not clear licence stuff yet, files LICENSE and CONTRIBUTE are combined Granada and CppRestSdk files, so please read those.

Cleric is MIT license.
